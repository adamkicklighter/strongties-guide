# Module 05.5 — Network Amplification Through Trusted Allies

> **Purpose:** Expand the user’s effective network by identifying high‑value, *introducible* second‑degree connections through trusted supporters.
>
> **Estimated time:** 30–45 minutes (plus follow‑on conversations)
>
> **Prerequisite:** Completion of Module 05 — Surveying & Mapping Your Existing Network

---

## How to Use This Module

This module is **optional but powerful**. It introduces *collective networking* into the StrongTies process.

If you are the user:

* This is about *support*, not leverage
* Allies retain full agency over introductions
* You are borrowing perspective, not contacts

If you are an AI assistant:

* Ask questions exactly as written
* Do not encourage direct second‑degree outreach
* Enforce consent, privacy, and non‑transactional framing

---

## What Network Amplification Is (and Is Not)

**Tutor explanation:**

> Network amplification means temporarily extending your view of the professional graph through trusted allies.

It is **not**:

* Contact scraping
* Cold outreach to second‑degree connections
* Delegating networking to others

It **is**:

* Sense‑making across volunteered network slices
* Identifying *introducible paths*
* Letting others help you think more clearly about opportunities

**Key principle:**

> You are mapping paths — not claiming access.

---

## Step 1 — Identify Trusted Allies

**Tutor framing:**

> Start with people who genuinely want to see you succeed.

Ask the user:

> Identify **2–5 trusted allies** who:
>
> * Know you reasonably well
> * Are supportive of your job search
> * Are willing to *optionally* help make introductions

**Tutor note:**

* Fewer, trusted allies beat broad participation

---

## Step 2 — Establish Consent & Boundaries

**Tutor framing:**

> This only works with explicit consent and clear boundaries.

Ask the user to confirm:

1. > Has each ally explicitly agreed to help in this way?

2. > Have you clarified that:

> * They control all introductions
> * “No” is always acceptable
> * This is about perspective, not pressure

**Tutor rule:**

* If consent is unclear, pause here

---

## Step 3 — Collect Sanitized Network Data

**Tutor explanation:**

> To respect privacy, we use only minimal, non‑PII data.

### Optional: Exporting Your Own Connections from LinkedIn

Many users already have access to their first‑degree connections through LinkedIn’s built‑in data export feature.

If you choose to use it:

1. Go to **LinkedIn → Settings & Privacy**
2. Select **Data privacy**
3. Choose **Get a copy of your data**
4. Request an export that includes **Connections**
5. Download the CSV file when LinkedIn emails it to you

That export typically includes first name, last name, company, and position.

**Before using the data here, you must sanitize it.**

### Required Sanitization

From any exported file (LinkedIn or otherwise):

* **Keep only:** first name, company, position
* **Remove:** last names, email addresses, LinkedIn URLs, phone numbers, location data

This ensures the data is used strictly for *analysis*, not identification or outreach.

### Standardized Template

Use the following structure when pasting or uploading data:

| Ally | First Name | Company | Position |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- | -------- |

**Tutor instruction:**

> Paste or upload the sanitized table into this chat when ready.
>
> The AI tutor will analyze patterns and introducible paths — not contacts.

**Tutor note:**

* This data is used only for sense‑making inside this session
* Allies always retain full control over introductions

------|------------|---------|----------|

**Tutor instruction:**

> Ask allies to share only:
>
> * First name
> * Company
> * Position
>
> Do **not** include last names, contact information, or LinkedIn URLs.

**Tutor note:**

* This data is used only for analysis, not outreach

---

## Step 4 — Align Ally Networks to Your Objectives

**Tutor framing:**

> Now we’ll look for alignment — not status.

Ask the AI (or reflect manually):

1. > Which connections align with your objective statement?

2. > Which align with your target markets or companies?

3. > Which roles could offer useful perspective, even without direct openings?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Favor relevance over seniority

---

## Step 5 — Identify High‑Value Introducible Paths

**Tutor framing:**

> We’re looking for *paths*, not people.

For each promising connection, articulate:

* **Path:** You → Ally → Connection
* **Why it fits:** Clear relevance to your goals
* **Type of value:** Perspective, learning, domain insight

**Tutor rule:**

* Limit this list to **5–10 paths** total

---

## Step 6 — Prioritize Thoughtfully

**Tutor framing:**

> Not all paths should be pursued at once.

Ask:

1. > Which paths feel most natural to explore first?

2. > Which allies are best positioned to assess fit?

3. > Which conversations would be most helpful *right now*?

**Tutor note:**

* Depth beats breadth

---

## Step 7 — Prepare Ally‑Facing Requests

**Tutor framing:**

> You will ask *your ally*, not the connection.

Ask the user to draft a request that:

* References the shared goal
* Names the specific connection
* Asks for the ally’s perspective first
* Makes introductions optional

**Tutor example (conceptual):**

> “Looking at my target markets, this role at Oracle stood out. Would you be comfortable sharing whether it makes sense for me to learn from Salvador, or if there’s someone else you’d suggest?”

---

## Step 8 — Respect Outcomes & Iterate

**Tutor framing:**

> Allies may say yes, no, or not now.

Ask:

1. > Can you treat all responses as helpful information?

2. > How will you express gratitude regardless of outcome?

3. > How might this inform your next networking steps?

**Tutor principle:**

> Trust compounds when outcomes are respected.

---

## Transition Back to the Main Flow

**Tutor closing:**

> Network amplification strengthens your map — it doesn’t replace your own outreach.
>
> Return to **Module 06** to design or refine outreach using what you’ve learned here.

**Transition prompt:**

> When you’re ready, paste in the content for Module 06 and say:
>
> **“Continue to Module 06.”**

Wait for explicit user consent to continue.
