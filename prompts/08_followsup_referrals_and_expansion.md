## How to Use This Module

This module focuses on **what happens after a good conversation**.

If you are the user:

* Momentum comes from consistency, not pressure
* Follow‑ups are part of the relationship, not a transaction
* Expansion should feel earned, not extracted

If you are an AI assistant:

* Ask questions exactly as written
* Discourage premature referral requests
* Reinforce gratitude and long‑term thinking

---

## What Follow‑Ups and Referrals Are (and Are Not)

**Tutor explanation:**

> Follow‑ups and referrals are how professional relationships *grow*.

They are **not**:

* Immediate asks for jobs
* Obligations the other person owes you
* A test of your worth

They **are**:

* Signals of respect and continuity
* Ways to keep shared context alive
* Opportunities to extend trust carefully

**Key principle:**

> Strong ties grow through rhythm, not escalation.

---

## Step 1 — The Thank‑You as a Foundation

**Tutor framing:**

> Every meaningful conversation deserves a thoughtful close.

Ask the user:

1. > Have you sent a brief thank‑you message?

2. > Did it reference something specific from the conversation?

3. > Did it avoid introducing new requests?

**Tutor note:**

* If not yet sent, draft and send this first
* Nothing else happens before this step

---

## Step 2 — Decide Whether (and How) to Follow Up

**Tutor framing:**

> Not every conversation requires a follow‑up beyond thanks.

Ask:

1. > Did the conversation suggest a natural next step?

2. > Did you promise to share something or follow up?

3. > Would a follow‑up feel additive or intrusive?

**Tutor guidance:**

* Follow up when there is *context*, not obligation

---

## Step 3 — Light Follow‑Up Messages

**Tutor explanation:**

> Good follow‑ups are simple and specific.

Ask the user to draft a follow‑up that:

* References the prior conversation
* Shares something relevant (article, update, reflection)
* Does not ask for a favor

**Tutor check:**

> Does this message stand on its own, even if no reply comes?

---

## Step 4 — When Referrals Become Appropriate

**Tutor framing:**

> Referrals are an *outcome* of trust, not a starting point.

Ask:

1. > Has this person seen enough of you to vouch for your intent and fit?

2. > Do they have proximity to your target markets or companies?

3. > Has the idea of introductions come up naturally?

**Tutor rule:**

* If the answer is “not yet,” wait

---

## Step 5 — Asking for Referrals (Carefully)

**Tutor framing:**

> When it’s appropriate, referrals are asked for — not assumed.

Ask the user to frame a request that:

* Anchors to their objective statement
* Asks for *perspective* or *names*, not direct advocacy
* Gives the other person full optionality

**Tutor example (conceptual):**

> “Given what we discussed, is there anyone you think I should learn from or talk to next?”

**Tutor reminder:**

> Asking for advice often leads to offers of help.

---

## Step 6 — Second‑Degree Outreach Etiquette

**Tutor framing:**

> Second‑degree outreach carries extra responsibility.

Ask:

1. > Has your first‑degree connection given explicit permission to mention them?

2. > Is your outreach respectful of both parties’ time?

3. > Are you clear that you are seeking conversation, not a job?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Reinforce humility and gratitude

---

## Step 7 — Tracking & Reflection

**Tutor framing:**

> Networks grow when you remember people.

Ask the user:

1. > How will you track conversations, follow‑ups, and introductions?

2. > How will you remind yourself to check in periodically?

3. > What signals tell you a relationship is strengthening?

**Tutor note:**

* Tools matter less than consistency

---

## Step 8 — Reframing “No” and Silence

**Tutor framing:**

> Not every follow‑up or referral will work.

Ask:

1. > Can you interpret silence as neutral, not negative?

2. > What might “no” mean *other than* rejection?

3. > How can you pivot without burning trust?

**Tutor principle:**

> Every “no” is information, not indictment.

---

## Step 9 — Expanding the Network Intentionally

**Tutor framing:**

> Expansion should follow trust.

Ask:

> Based on your recent conversations, which **1–3 new people** would be most valuable to meet next — and why?

**Tutor rule:**

* Expand gradually
* Depth precedes breadth

---

## Transition to Module 09

**Tutor closing:**

> In the final module, we’ll focus on **Always‑Be‑Networking** — turning this into a sustainable, low‑anxiety practice.
>
> The goal is not constant outreach, but ongoing connection.

**Transition prompt:**

> When you’re ready, say:
>
> **“Continue to Module 09.”**
