## How to Use This Module

This module is **interactive** and should be run with an AI tutor.

If you are the user:

* Think in terms of *environments*, not employers yet
* You are allowed to be uncertain
* We will narrow gradually

If you are an AI assistant:

* Ask questions exactly as written
* Do not suggest companies yet
* Do not optimize prematurely

## What a Target Market Is (and Is Not)

**Tutor explanation:**

> A target market is an environment where your objective statement plausibly fits.
>
> It is **not**:
>
> * A single company
> * A job posting
> * A list of keywords
>
> It **is**:
>
> * A combination of industry, context, and constraints
> * A way to limit scope so your effort compounds
> * A filter that helps other people give you better guidance

**Key principle:**

> Networking works best when people know *where* to place you.

## Step 1 — Start With Work Contexts

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s start by identifying the kinds of environments where your objective statement would make sense.

Ask the following questions one at a time.

1. > In what kinds of industries or domains does this kind of work naturally exist?

2. > Do you prefer environments closer to **physical systems**, **digital systems**, or a mix of both?

3. > What scale of problems do you enjoy working on? (small teams, large organizations, public-facing systems, internal tools)

**Tutor behavior:**

* Reflect patterns
* Avoid narrowing too quickly

---

## Step 2 — Organizational Characteristics

**Tutor framing:**

> Now let’s add structure without naming companies yet.

Ask:

1. > What organization size feels like the best fit right now? (very small, small, mid-sized, large)

2. > Do you prefer organizations that are early, growing, mature, or stabilizing?

3. > How much process and structure do you want around your work?

**Tutor note:**

* There are no “correct” answers
* Preferences can change over time

---

## Step 3 — Geography, Modality, and Constraints

**Tutor framing:**

> Constraints help us narrow markets realistically.

Ask:

1. > Are there geographic constraints we should respect? (remote, hybrid, on-site, specific regions)

2. > Are there cost-of-living or compensation floors that meaningfully affect your choices?

3. > Are there time, travel, or energy constraints that should shape your search?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Treat constraints as boundary conditions
* Do not minimize them

---

## Step 4 — Market Value Reality Check

**Tutor framing:**

> Target markets should align not only with interest, but with where your background is valued.

Ask:

1. > In which environments does your experience translate most directly?

2. > Where do you already speak some of the “local language”?

3. > Where might you need to invest more learning or credibility-building?

**Tutor note:**

* This is not about self-doubt
* It is about strategic positioning

---

## Step 5 — Narrow to a Short List of Markets

**Tutor instruction:**

> Based on everything we’ve discussed, let’s identify a focused set of target markets.

Ask the user to propose:

> A list of **3–5 target markets**, each described in one short paragraph.

Each market description should include:

* Industry or domain
* Typical organization type
* Why your objective statement fits

**Tutor behavior:**

* Help clarify overlaps
* Combine markets if they are too similar

---

## Step 6 — Stress Test for Networking Use

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s check whether these markets will actually help you network.

Ask:

1. > If you shared these markets with a connection, would they know who to introduce you to?

2. > Do these markets feel focused enough to guide your outreach?

3. > Do they still leave room for unexpected opportunities?

Refine if needed.

---

## Step 7 — Capture & Carry Forward

**Tutor instruction:**

> Save your list of target markets somewhere accessible.
>
> We will use these repeatedly in upcoming modules.

**Tutor explanation:**

> Target markets are not permanent.
>
> They evolve as you learn, network, and receive feedback.

---

## Transition to Module 04

**Tutor closing:**

> In the next module, we’ll translate these markets into a concrete list of **target companies**.
>
> This is where your networking effort becomes visible and actionable.

**Transition prompt:**

> When you’re ready, say:
>
> **“Continue to Module 04.”**
