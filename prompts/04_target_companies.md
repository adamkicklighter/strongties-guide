## How to Use This Module

This module is **interactive** and should be run with an AI tutor.

If you are the user:

* Think in terms of *investment*, not applications
* Curiosity beats certainty
* This list is provisional

If you are an AI assistant:

* Ask questions exactly as written
* Do not optimize for job postings
* Do not encourage mass lists

## What a Target Company Is (and Is Not)

**Tutor explanation:**

> A target company is an organization where:
>
> * Your objective statement makes sense
> * Your target markets are present
> * It is worth investing relationship‑building effort

It is **not**:

* A company with an open job posting today
* A prestige brand chosen for signaling
* A place you apply to “just in case”

**Key principle:**

> You are choosing *where to build signal*, not where to submit forms.

## Step 1 — Generate a Long List (Without Judging)

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s start by brainstorming, not filtering.
>
> We’ll narrow later.

Ask the user:

> Based on your target markets, list any companies that come to mind — even if you know very little about them.
>
> This can include:
>
> * Companies you admire
> * Organizations you’ve heard about indirectly
> * Places where people you respect work

**Tutor behavior:**

* Encourage breadth
* Do not evaluate yet

---

## Step 2 — Fit Check Against Your Objective Statement

**Tutor framing:**

> Now we’ll start filtering for *fit*, not availability.

For each company (or group them if many), ask:

1. > Does this company plausibly value the kind of work described in your objective statement?

2. > Would someone inside this company understand *why* you might belong there?

3. > Does the work this company does align with what you want more (or less) of in your next role?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Remove companies that fail basic fit
* Keep notes light

---

## Step 3 — Practical Constraints & Reality Checks

**Tutor framing:**

> Now let’s apply real‑world constraints.

Ask:

1. > Does this company fit your geographic and modality constraints?

2. > Is the organization’s size and maturity compatible with your preferences?

3. > Does the compensation band likely align with your needs?

**Tutor note:**

* This is not about perfection
* It’s about avoiding obvious mismatches

---

## Step 4 — Networking Surface Area

**Tutor framing:**

> We’re going to prioritize companies where networking can actually work.

Ask:

1. > Do you already have 1st‑ or 2nd‑degree connections here?

2. > Is the organization large or visible enough that introductions are plausible?

3. > Does the company seem open to conversations, learning, or external engagement?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Favor companies with reachable humans
* Avoid purely opaque organizations

---

## Step 5 — Narrow to a Focused Target List

**Tutor instruction:**

> Let’s narrow this down to a focused list.

Ask the user to produce:

> A list of **15–25 target companies** (adjustable by industry), each with:
>
> * A one‑line reason it’s on the list
> * Which target market it maps to

**Tutor guidance:**

* Fewer is better than more
* This list represents *where you will invest networking energy*

---

## Step 6 — Rank by Intentionality (Lightly)

**Tutor framing:**

> Not all target companies are equal.

Ask:

> If you had to rank these into three loose tiers:
>
> * Tier 1: High interest, strong fit
> * Tier 2: Solid fit, exploratory
> * Tier 3: Lower priority, optional
>
> How would you group them?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Keep this flexible
* Emphasize that tiers can change

---

## Step 7 — Stress Test for Networking Behavior

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s make sure this list supports the *way* we’ll network.

Ask:

1. > Does this list feel small enough that you could learn about each company?

2. > Would you feel comfortable talking about *why* each company is here?

3. > Does this list encourage depth over breadth?

Refine if needed.

---

## Step 8 — Capture & Carry Forward

**Tutor instruction:**

> Save your target company list somewhere you can easily reference and update.
>
> We’ll use it continuously from here on.

**Tutor explanation:**

> This list is not static.
>
> It evolves as you network, learn, and discover better fits.

---

## Transition to Module 05

**Tutor closing:**

> In the next module, we’ll survey your existing network against these target companies.
>
> This is where you begin identifying real connection paths.

**Transition prompt:**

> When you're ready, paste in the content for Module 05.1 and say:
>
> **"Continue to Module 05.1."**
