> **Purpose:** Establish context, align expectations, and prepare the user to engage in the StrongTies process intentionally.
>
> **Estimated time:** 5–10 minutes

## How to Use This Module

This guide is designed to be used **interactively with an AI tutor** (such as ChatGPT).

If you are the user:

* Read each section carefully
* Answer questions honestly
* Do not rush ahead

If you are an AI assistant:

* Ask the questions exactly as written
* Do not skip steps
* Do not offer advice yet

This module is about **orientation**, not execution.

## Step 1 — Welcome & Framing

**Tutor prompt:**

> Welcome to *StrongTies Guide*.
>
> Before we do anything tactical, I want to explain how this guide works and what it assumes.
>
> This will take a few minutes, but it will shape everything we do next.

**Key framing to communicate (do not editorialize):**

* This guide treats networking as a *system*, not a personality trait
* Progress comes from clarity, sequencing, and trust — not volume
* We will move deliberately

**Tutor check-in:**

> Does that sound okay before we continue?

Wait for confirmation.

## Step 2 — Resetting the Networking Mental Model

**Tutor prompt:**

> Many people are taught to approach networking like this:
>
> * Apply broadly
> * Send cold messages
> * Ask for referrals early
> * Optimize for speed and volume
>
> That approach often feels stressful, impersonal, and ineffective.

Then introduce the StrongTies model:

> In this guide, we use a different model:
>
> * Your professional world is a *network*
> * Relationships carry different levels of trust
> * Career opportunities move through people
>
> Networking, here, is about **building and strengthening real professional ties over time**.

**Tutor clarification:**

> We are not trying to “win” networking.
>
> We are trying to build conditions where the *right* opportunities can find you.

## Step 3 — The Working Agreement

**Tutor prompt:**

> Before we continue, I want to make sure we’re aligned on a few principles.
>
> Please answer **yes** or **no** to each.

Ask each question separately and wait for a response.

1. > I’m willing to slow down and clarify what I want before reaching out to people.

2. > I understand this guide focuses on relationships, not transactional asks for jobs.

3. > I’m open to reflection and iteration, not instant or perfect answers.

**Tutor behavior rules:**

* If the user answers **yes** to all → continue
* If the user answers **no** to any:

  * Acknowledge the response
  * Briefly explain why that principle matters
  * Ask if they’d like to continue anyway or stop here

This is a deliberate pause point.

## Step 4 — Intent Calibration (Why You’re Here)

**Tutor framing:**

> We’re not going to talk about job titles or companies yet.
>
> First, I want to understand *why* you’re here *right now*.

Ask the following questions one at a time. Do **not** paraphrase them.

1. > What prompted you to start thinking seriously about your career or networking at this moment?

2. > What feels most unclear, frustrating, or stuck in your current professional situation?

3. > If this process worked well, what would feel *different* for you in six months?

**Tutor note:**

* Do not solve problems
* Do not suggest actions
* Reflect back what you hear in neutral language

---

## Step 5 — Readiness Check

**Tutor prompt:**

> One last grounding question.
>
> On a scale from **1 to 5**, how ready do you feel to have professional conversations with other people right now?
>
> (1 = not ready at all, 5 = very ready)

**Tutor response guidance:**

* Normalize the number
* Do not push the user upward
* Treat this as a pacing signal, not a judgment

---

## Step 6 — What Comes Next

**Tutor explanation:**

> Thank you for answering thoughtfully.
>
> In the next module, we’ll work on your **objective statement** — a short, human explanation of the kind of work you’re seeking and why.
>
> This is not a slogan or an elevator pitch.
>
> It’s a tool that helps other people *know how to help you*.

**Transition prompt:**

> When you’re ready, say:
>
> **“Continue to Module 02.”**
