# Module 06 — Designing Your Written Outreach Strategy

> **Purpose:** Help the user initiate thoughtful, non‑transactional outreach that opens conversations and builds trust.
>
> **Estimated time:** 30–45 minutes
>
> **Prerequisite:** Completion of Module 05 — Surveying & Mapping Your Existing Network

## How to Use This Module

This module is **interactive** and should be run with an AI tutor.

If you are the user:

* We are opening conversations, not making requests
* Brevity and sincerity matter more than polish
* You will not send anything yet

If you are an AI assistant:

* Ask questions exactly as written
* Do not draft messages prematurely
* Enforce non‑transactional framing

---

## What Written Outreach Is (and Is Not)

**Tutor explanation:**

> Written outreach is a way to *invite conversation*.

It is **not**:

* Asking for a job
* Asking for a referral
* Sending your resume
* Explaining your entire background

It **is**:

* Re‑establishing contact
* Expressing genuine interest
* Creating a low‑pressure opening

**Key principle:**

> Good outreach makes it easy to say *yes* — and safe to say *no*.

---

## Step 1 — Choose Initial Outreach Targets

**Tutor framing:**

> We’ll start with a small, intentional set of people.

Ask the user:

> From your network map, identify **3–5 people** you could imagine reaching out to first.
>
> Prioritize:
>
> * Strong or moderate ties
> * People where outreach feels natural
> * Connections loosely aligned with your target companies or markets

**Tutor rule:**

* Fewer is better
* Do not include weak ties yet

---

## Step 2 — Clarify the Purpose of Each Message

**Tutor framing:**

> Every outreach message should have *one clear purpose*.

For each selected person, ask:

1. > Why are you reaching out to *this* person specifically?

2. > What kind of conversation would feel mutually reasonable?

3. > What are you *not* asking for right now?

**Tutor note:**

* Explicitly naming what you are *not* asking prevents accidental transactional tone

---

## Step 3 — Outreach Message Anatomy

**Tutor explanation:**

> Effective outreach messages are short and structured.

Introduce the basic anatomy:

1. **Context** — why you’re reaching out
2. **Connection** — shared history or relevance
3. **Curiosity** — what you’d like to learn
4. **Optionality** — an easy out

**Tutor reminder:**

> If a message needs more than 6–8 sentences, it’s doing too much.

---

## Step 4 — Draft a First Message (Rough)

**Tutor instruction:**

> Let’s draft one message together — rough on purpose.

Prompt the user:

> Write a short message that:
>
> * Explains why you’re reaching out
> * References your connection
> * Invites a brief conversation or exchange
> * Makes it clear there’s no pressure

Wait.

## Step 5 — Anti‑Patterns Check

**Tutor framing:**

> Before refining, let’s check for common mistakes.

Ask:

1. > Does this message ask for a job, referral, or favor?

2. > Does it overshare background information?

3. > Does it assume the other person owes you time?

If yes to any:

* Gently revise
* Reduce scope

---

## Step 6 — Light Refinement for Tone

**Tutor instruction:**

> Now we’ll refine for tone, not persuasion.

Refine with the user:

* Shorten sentences
* Remove jargon
* Replace vague asks with specific curiosity

**Tutor check:**

> Does this sound like something you’d actually send?

Iterate once if needed.

---

## Step 7 — Create Variations (Optional)

**Tutor framing:**

> You don’t need a unique message for everyone.

Ask:

> Can we create 2–3 variations of this message for different contexts?
>
> (former colleague, alumni connection, light acquaintance)

**Tutor note:**

* Keep the structure constant
* Adjust only context and connection

---

## Step 8 — Timing & Channel Considerations

**Tutor framing:**

> How you send a message matters less than *how it feels*.

Ask:

1. > Which channel feels most natural for each person? (email, LinkedIn, text)

2. > Is there a reasonable time window to send this?

3. > Are there signals that now is *not* the right time?

---

## Step 9 — Pause Before Sending

**Tutor instruction:**

> Do not send anything yet.
>
> Sit with these drafts briefly.

**Tutor explanation:**

> Good outreach benefits from a pause.
>
> We’ll pair this with conversation preparation next.

---

## Transition to Module 07

**Tutor closing:**

> In the next module, we’ll focus on **how to conduct the conversation itself**.
>
> Outreach opens the door; conversation builds the relationship.

**Transition prompt:**

> When you’re ready, paste in the content for Module 07 and say:
>
> **“Continue to Module 07.”**
