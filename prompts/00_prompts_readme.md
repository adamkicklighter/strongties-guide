# StrongTies Guide — How to Use the Prompt Modules

This document explains how to use the `/prompts` directory as an **interactive, AI‑tutored curriculum**.

The StrongTies Guide is not a static reading experience. It is designed to be *run*—step by step—by an AI assistant acting as a tutor.

---

## Quick Start (Recommended)

You can complete the entire StrongTies Guide using ChatGPT or any comparable LLM.

### Minimal Setup

1. Start a new AI chat session
2. Paste the project context file (`CONTEXT.md`)
3. Paste the first module:

   * `prompts/01_orientation_and_intent.md`
4. Say:

> **“Act as the AI tutor described in this file and begin Module 01.”**

The tutor will guide you through the module interactively.

When a module ends, proceed by pasting the next module and saying:

> **“Continue to Module 0X.”**

## Module Sequencing (Important)

The modules are intentionally ordered. Do **not** skip ahead.

| Module | Focus                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| 01     | Orientation & intent              |
| 02     | Objective statement               |
| 03     | Target markets                    |
| 04     | Target companies                  |
| 05     | Network survey & mapping          |
| 06     | Written outreach strategy         |
| 07     | Conversations & meetings          |
| 08     | Follow‑ups, referrals & expansion |
| 09     | Always‑be‑networking maintenance  |

Each module:

* Builds on artifacts from previous modules
* Establishes behavioral constraints for the AI tutor
* Ends with explicit consent to continue

## How the AI Tutor Is Expected to Behave

Each module includes instructions **for the AI assistant**.

When run correctly, the tutor should:

* Ask questions exactly as written
* Avoid giving advice prematurely
* Enforce non‑transactional networking principles
* Slow the user down when necessary
* Treat networking as a human system, not a hack

If the assistant starts skipping steps or offering shortcuts, re‑anchor it by saying:

> “Please follow the module verbatim.”

## Capstone Reflection (Optional but Recommended)

After completing Module 09, users may choose to complete the following **capstone reflection**.

### Capstone — Integration & Reflection

**Purpose:** Consolidate learning, reinforce mindset shifts, and set forward‑looking intent.

Ask yourself (or have the tutor ask):

1. How has your understanding of networking changed from when you started?
2. What behaviors do you want to keep, even when you are not job searching?
3. Which relationships feel meaningfully stronger now?
4. What surprised you most about this process?
5. What would “networking well” look like for you one year from now?

This reflection is not graded or evaluated. It exists to help the learning *stick*.

## Using StrongTies as a Custom GPT (Optional)

For advanced users, StrongTies can be run as a **Custom GPT** or system‑prompted agent.

### Suggested Setup

* **System prompt:** Contents of `CONTEXT.md`
* **Instructional corpus:** All files in `/prompts`
* **User instruction:**

> “You are the StrongTies AI tutor. Run the modules sequentially and do not skip steps unless the user explicitly asks.”

This allows:

* Persistent context across sessions
* Cleaner UX (no copy‑paste between modules)
* Easier revisiting of prior artifacts

---

## Philosophy Reminder

StrongTies is intentionally slower than most career advice.

That is a feature, not a bug.

The goal is not to optimize networking.
The goal is to **practice it well, consistently, and humanely**.

## End of Guide

You may return to any module at any time.

Use what serves you. Leave what doesn’t.
