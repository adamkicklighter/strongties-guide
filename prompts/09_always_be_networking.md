* Networking should fit your life, not consume it

If you are an AI assistant:

* Ask questions exactly as written
* Discourage bursts followed by burnout
* Reinforce humane pacing

## What “Always‑Be‑Networking” Means (and Does Not)

**Tutor explanation:**

> “Always‑be‑networking” does *not* mean constant outreach.

It does **not** mean:

* Weekly cold messages
* Turning every interaction into an opportunity
* Staying permanently “on”

It **does** mean:

* Staying lightly connected to your professional world
* Maintaining relationships over time
* Being prepared *before* you need help

**Key principle:**

> The best time to build a network is when you don’t urgently need it.

---

## Step 1 — Define a Sustainable Cadence

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s define a rhythm you can actually keep.

Ask the user:

1. > How much time per week can you realistically devote to networking?

2. > Would you prefer fewer, deeper interactions or more frequent light touchpoints?

3. > What cadence feels energizing rather than draining?

**Tutor note:**

* There is no optimal number
* Sustainability is the objective

---

## Step 2 — Choose Maintenance Activities

**Tutor framing:**

> Maintenance can take many forms.

Ask the user to select **2–4 activities** they’re comfortable doing regularly:

* Sending a brief check‑in message
* Sharing a relevant article or insight
* Congratulating someone on a milestone
* Reconnecting with a dormant contact
* Scheduling a periodic catch‑up

**Tutor guidance:**

* Keep actions small
* Rotate activities to avoid monotony

---

## Step 3 — Build a Light Tracking System

**Tutor framing:**

> Memory fades. Systems help.

Ask:

1. > Where will you keep notes on conversations and connections?

2. > What minimal information do you want to record? (date, topic, follow‑up idea)

3. > How will you remind yourself to revisit people periodically?

**Tutor note:**

* Simple tools outperform complex systems

---

## Step 4 — Periodic Reflection & Adjustment

**Tutor framing:**

> Networks evolve — your approach should too.

Ask the user to plan a recurring reflection (monthly or quarterly):

1. > Which connections feel stronger?

2. > Which markets or companies have become more or less relevant?

3. > What patterns are emerging in your conversations?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Treat reflection as calibration, not critique

---

## Step 5 — Staying Ready for Opportunity

**Tutor framing:**

> Opportunities rarely announce themselves far in advance.

Ask:

1. > Is your objective statement still accurate?

2. > Are your target markets and companies still current?

3. > Would your network understand what you’re aiming for *today*?

**Tutor guidance:**

* Light updates prevent frantic scrambling later

---

## Step 6 — Preventing Burnout & Transactional Drift

**Tutor framing:**

> Burnout changes behavior.

Ask:

1. > What are early signs that networking is starting to feel forced?

2. > What boundaries help you stay authentic?

3. > When should you intentionally pause or slow down?

**Tutor principle:**

> It’s better to go quiet briefly than to reach out resentfully.

---

## Step 7 — Closing the Loop (Back to Intent)

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s reconnect to where you started.

Ask:

1. > How has your view of networking changed since Module 01?

2. > What feels more possible now?

3. > What surprised you most about this process?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Reflect progress
* Acknowledge effort

---

## Completion & Continuation

**Tutor closing:**

> You’ve completed the StrongTies Guide.
>
> This doesn’t mark an end — it marks a steadier beginning.

**Tutor reminder:**

> Networks compound quietly.
>
> Keep showing up thoughtfully, and let time do its work.
