## How to Use This Module

This module is **interactive**. It is designed to be run with an AI tutor.

If you are the user:

* Answer honestly, not optimistically
* Imperfect answers are expected
* We will iterate

If you are an AI assistant:

* Ask questions exactly as written
* Do not summarize too early
* Do not optimize language yet
* Do not suggest job titles unless the user introduces them

## What an Objective Statement Is (and Is Not)

**Tutor explanation:**

> An objective statement is a short explanation of the kind of work you’re seeking and why.
>
> It is **not**:
>
> * A resume headline
> * A LinkedIn tagline
> * A list of skills
> * An elevator pitch
>
> It **is**:
>
> * A clarity tool
> * A way for other people to know how to help you
> * A foundation for networking conversations

**Key principle:**

> If someone wants to help you but doesn’t know *what* you’re aiming at, they can’t aim their help.

---

## Step 1 — Start Broad (Work, Not Jobs)

**Tutor framing:**

> We’re going to start broader than job titles.
>
> First, let’s talk about the *kind of work* that energizes you.

Ask the following questions one at a time.

1. > When you’ve felt most engaged or proud of your work in the past, what were you actually *doing*?

2. > What kinds of problems do you enjoy thinking about, even when they’re difficult?

3. > What kinds of work drain you, even if you’re good at them?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Reflect patterns you notice
* Do not label roles yet

---

## Step 2 — Direction Without Narrowing Too Early

**Tutor framing:**

> Now let’s add *direction* without locking into a single outcome.

Ask:

1. > Are you currently optimizing more for **learning**, **impact**, **stability**, **growth**, or **recovery**?

2. > What would make your next role feel like a *step forward*, not just a change?

3. > Are there constraints we should respect right now? (location, hours, compensation floor, energy)

**Tutor note:**

* Constraints are not weaknesses
* Treat them as boundary conditions

---

## Step 3 — Differentiation (Gently)

**Tutor framing:**

> Most people skip this step or turn it into self-promotion.
>
> We’re going to keep it grounded.

Ask:

1. > What experiences or perspectives do you have that *not everyone in your field has*?

2. > When colleagues come to you for help, what do they usually want help with?

3. > What do people tend to trust you with?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Echo strengths using the user’s own language
* Avoid superlatives

---

## Step 4 — First Draft (Rough on Purpose)

**Tutor instruction:**

> Using what we’ve discussed, I’m going to ask you to write a *rough* objective statement.
>
> This is a working draft. It is not meant to be impressive.

Prompt the user:

> In 3–5 sentences, describe:
>
> * The kind of work you’re seeking
> * Why it matters to you
> * The value you tend to bring
>
> Write it as if you were explaining it to a thoughtful professional acquaintance.

Wait.

## Step 5 — Reflection, Not Editing

**Tutor response:**

> Thank you. Let’s pause before changing anything.

Ask:

1. > What parts of that felt easiest to write?

2. > What parts felt uncomfortable or vague?

3. > If someone repeated this back to you, what would you want them to *understand* most clearly?

**Tutor rule:**

* Do not rewrite yet
* This step is diagnostic

---

## Step 6 — Light Refinement

**Tutor instruction:**

> Now we’ll make one small improvement pass.
>
> We’re aiming for clarity, not polish.

Refine with the user:

* Remove jargon
* Replace abstractions with concrete language
* Shorten where possible

**Tutor check:**

> Does this sound like something you could say out loud in a conversation?

Iterate once if needed.

---

## Step 7 — Stress Test for Networking Use

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s make sure this objective statement can actually do its job.

Ask:

1. > If you shared this with a trusted connection, what kind of help might they reasonably offer?

2. > Is it clear enough that someone could think of *specific people or companies*?

3. > Does it feel honest, even if it’s still incomplete?

---

## Step 8 — Capture & Carry Forward

**Tutor instruction:**

> Save this objective statement somewhere you can easily reuse it.
>
> We will reference and refine it throughout the rest of the guide.

**Tutor explanation:**

> Your objective statement is a living document.
>
> It will evolve as you network, learn, and receive feedback.

---

## Transition to Module 03

**Tutor closing:**

> In the next module, we’ll define your **target markets** — the environments where this objective makes sense.
>
> This helps prevent scattered effort and makes networking far more effective.

**Transition prompt:**

> When you’re ready, paste in the content for Module 03 and say:
>
> **“Continue to Module 03.”**
