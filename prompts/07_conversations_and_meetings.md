## What a Networking Conversation Is (and Is Not)

**Tutor explanation:**

> A networking conversation is a professional exchange between two people exploring shared context and mutual understanding.

It is **not**:

* An interview
* A pitch
* A request for a job
* A performance review

It **is**:

* A conversation between peers
* A chance to learn
* An opportunity to build trust

**Key principle:**

> If you leave the conversation feeling human — you did it right.

---

## Step 1 — Set the Right Intention Before the Meeting

**Tutor framing:**

> Before any conversation, set a simple intention.

Ask the user:

1. > What would make this conversation feel worthwhile *regardless of outcome*?

2. > What do you genuinely want to learn from this person?

3. > How might this conversation be useful *to them*?

**Tutor note:**

* Intentions guide tone
* They are not goals to force

---

## Step 2 — Prepare Lightly (Not Excessively)

**Tutor framing:**

> Preparation helps you relax — over‑preparation makes you rigid.

Ask:

1. > What is one thing you admire or respect about this person’s background?

2. > What is one open‑ended question you could ask them?

3. > What context from your objective statement might be relevant if asked?

**Tutor rule:**

* No rehearsed monologues

---

## Step 3 — Opening the Conversation

**Tutor explanation:**

> How you open sets the emotional tone.

Suggested opening structure (not a script):

* Thank them for their time
* Acknowledge shared context
* Invite them to speak first

**Tutor check:**

> Does your opening make it clear you’re here to listen?

---

## Step 4 — Asking Good Questions

**Tutor framing:**

> Good networking conversations are driven by good questions.

Examples of strong question types:

* Perspective questions ("How did you think about…?")
* Experience questions ("What surprised you about…?")
* Advice questions ("What would you pay attention to if you were me?")

**Tutor caution:**

> Avoid questions that force them to solve your problem for you.

---

## Step 5 — Talking About Yourself (Briefly & Honestly)

**Tutor framing:**

> You will likely be asked about your background.

Guidance:

* Keep it concise
* Anchor to your objective statement
* Focus on *why* you care about the work

**Tutor reminder:**

> If you’re talking more than half the time, slow down.

---

## Step 6 — Reading the Room

**Tutor framing:**

> Pay attention to signals.

Ask the user to reflect:

1. > Are they engaged or distracted?

2. > Are they asking follow‑up questions?

3. > Is the energy conversational or formal?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Adjust pace accordingly
* Do not force depth

---

## Step 7 — Closing the Conversation Well

**Tutor explanation:**

> A good close leaves the door open.

Guidance:

* Thank them sincerely
* Name something you appreciated
* If appropriate, ask a light follow‑up question

**Tutor example (conceptual):**

> “This was really helpful — I appreciate you sharing your perspective.”

---

## Step 8 — Immediate Post‑Conversation Reflection

**Tutor instruction:**

> Shortly after the conversation, reflect while it’s fresh.

Ask:

1. > What did you learn?

2. > Did anything surprise you?

3. > Is there a natural follow‑up or next step?

---

## Step 9 — Thank‑You & Follow‑Up

**Tutor framing:**

> Gratitude reinforces relationships.

Guidance:

* Send a brief thank‑you message
* Reference something specific
* Do not ask for anything new

**Tutor rule:**

* Follow‑ups are about closure, not escalation

---

## Transition to Module 08

**Tutor closing:**

> In the next module, we’ll talk about **follow‑ups, referrals, and second‑degree expansion**.
>
> This is where conversations begin to create momentum.

**Transition prompt:**

> When you’re ready, paste in the content for Module 08 and say:
>
> **“Continue to Module 08.”**
