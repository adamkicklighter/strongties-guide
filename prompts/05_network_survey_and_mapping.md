## How to Use This Module

This module is **interactive** and should be run with an AI tutor.

If you are the user:

* Assume you know fewer people than you actually do
* Focus on *relationships*, not favors
* Be honest about connection strength

If you are an AI assistant:

* Ask questions exactly as written
* Do not script outreach yet
* Do not judge connection quality

## What Network Mapping Is (and Is Not)

**Tutor explanation:**

> Network mapping is the process of making your existing professional relationships visible.

It is **not**:

* Asking people for anything yet
* Ranking people by usefulness
* Broadcasting that you are job searching

It **is**:

* Taking inventory
* Identifying possible connection paths
* Understanding where trust already exists

**Key principle:**

> You are discovering *paths*, not making requests.

---

## Step 1 — Start With First‑Degree Connections

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s begin with people you already know directly.

Ask the user:

> List people you could reasonably message today without it feeling strange.
>
> This can include:
>
> * Former colleagues or managers
> * Current coworkers
> * Clients, vendors, or partners
> * Alumni, classmates, instructors
> * Friends, neighbors, or family (when professionally relevant)

**Tutor behavior:**

* Encourage recall across time
* Do not filter yet

---

## Step 2 — Identify Connection Strength

**Tutor framing:**

> Not all connections are equal — and that’s okay.

For each person (or groups of people), ask:

1. > Have you worked directly together?

2. > When was your last meaningful interaction?

3. > Would reaching out feel natural or forced?

**Tutor instruction:**

> Lightly categorize each connection as:
>
> * Strong tie
> * Moderate tie
> * Weak tie

**Tutor note:**

* This is for strategy, not judgment

---

## Step 3 — Map Connections to Target Companies

**Tutor framing:**

> Now let’s connect your network to your target companies.

Ask:

> For each target company, do you know:
>
> * Anyone who works there now?
> * Anyone who worked there previously?
> * Anyone who works in a closely related organization?

**Tutor behavior:**

* Capture even indirect links
* Do not assume usefulness yet

---

## Step 4 — Surface Second‑Degree Paths

**Tutor framing:**

> Second‑degree connections are often where networking momentum appears.

Ask:

1. > Which of your first‑degree connections might know people at your target companies?

2. > Are there shared institutions (schools, employers, professional groups) that create overlap?

3. > Are there people whose networks you trust, even if you don’t know them well?

**Tutor explanation:**

> You are identifying *possible bridges*, not guaranteed introductions.

---

## Step 5 — Visualize the Network (Conceptually)

**Tutor framing:**

> You don’t need special software to think this way.

Explain:

> Imagine:
>
> * You at the center
> * Your first‑degree connections as nearby nodes
> * Target companies as clusters
> * Potential paths connecting them

**Tutor check:**

> Does this mental model help you see where paths already exist?

---

## Step 6 — Identify Promising Connection Paths

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s identify a *small number* of promising paths.

Ask:

> Which 5–10 connections:
>
> * Feel most natural to engage
> * Are closest to your target companies
> * Have sufficient trust to start a conversation

**Tutor rule:**

* Do not contact anyone yet
* This is still planning

---

## Step 7 — Stress Test for Readiness

**Tutor framing:**

> Let’s pause and check how this feels.

Ask:

1. > Does this exercise reveal more connections than you expected?

2. > Do any paths feel surprisingly approachable?

3. > Does anything feel uncomfortable or unclear?

Normalize all responses.

---

## Step 8 — Capture & Carry Forward

**Tutor instruction:**

> Save your network notes in a form you can update.
>
> This could be a document, spreadsheet, or notebook.

**Tutor explanation:**

> Network maps evolve.
>
> This is a living system, not a static list.

---

## Transition to Module 06

**Tutor closing:**

> In the next module, we’ll design your **initial outreach strategy**.
>
> This is where message passing begins — carefully and intentionally.

**Transition prompt:**

> When you’re ready, say:
>
> **“Continue to Module 06.”**
