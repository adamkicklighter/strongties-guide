# StrongTies Guide

**An AI‑assisted guide to building meaningful professional networks**

StrongTies Guide is an open, practical framework for helping people network *better* — more intentionally, more authentically, and with far better outcomes than high‑volume, transactional job searching.

This repository is designed to be used **with an AI chatbot (such as ChatGPT)** as a step‑by‑step companion. The AI walks users through a sequence of structured prompts that help them clarify goals, map their professional network, and take concrete, human‑centered actions.

The guide is based on the *Deep Professional Networks* framework developed by Adam Kicklighter and presented publicly in 2025.

## Why StrongTies?

Most job search advice focuses on volume:

* Apply to more roles
* Optimize keywords
* Beat the ATS

StrongTies takes a different position:

> **Careers advance through people, trust, and context — not application counts.**

Strong professional networks dramatically increase the likelihood that:

* Your application is actually seen
* You’re considered for roles *before* they’re public
* You receive referrals grounded in real trust

StrongTies exists to make that process **explicit, repeatable, and humane**.

## Core Mental Model

StrongTies treats your professional network as a **graph**:

* **Nodes**: You, companies, roles, hiring managers, connections
* **Edges**: Employment relationships, mutual connections, shared history
* **Edge weights**: Trust, familiarity, proximity, credibility

Networking actions are framed as **message passing**:

| Graph Concept   | Real‑World Meaning                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Node embedding  | Your professional profile & reputation   |
| Edge weight     | Strength of a relationship               |
| Message passing | Outreach, conversations, introductions   |
| Gradient update | Adjusting strategy based on feedback     |
| Convergence     | Visibility + trust in the hiring network |

The goal is *not* to “ask for a job.”

The goal is to **maximize the probability that the right people seriously consider you**, mediated by trusted connections.

## Guiding Principles

StrongTies is opinionated. It assumes:

* Networking is **not transactional**
* You ask for **advice, not jobs**
* Clarity comes *before* outreach
* Rejection is feedback, not failure
* Long‑term relationships beat short‑term tactics

If you’re looking for growth‑hacks or mass‑application tricks, this guide is intentionally not that.

## A Note on Tone

StrongTies is built on respect — for your time, for other people’s time, and for the reality that careers are deeply human systems.

The aim is not to “win” networking.

The aim is to **build real professional ties that compound over time**.
