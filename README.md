# StrongTies Guide

**An AI-assisted guide to building meaningful professional networks**

StrongTies Guide is an open, practical framework for helping people network *better* — more intentionally, more authentically, and with far better outcomes than high-volume, transactional job searching.

This repository is designed to be used **with an AI chatbot (such as ChatGPT)** as a step-by-step companion. The AI acts as a tutor, guiding users through a structured sequence of prompts that help them clarify goals, map their professional network, and take concrete, human-centered actions.

The guide is based on the *Deep Professional Networks* framework developed by Adam Kicklighter and presented publicly in 2025.

## Why StrongTies?

Most job search advice focuses on volume:

* Apply to more roles
* Optimize keywords
* Beat the ATS

StrongTies takes a different position:

> **Careers advance through people, trust, and context — not application counts.**

Strong professional networks dramatically increase the likelihood that:

* Your application is actually seen
* You’re considered for roles *before* they’re public
* You receive referrals grounded in real trust

StrongTies exists to make that process **explicit, repeatable, and humane**.

## Core Mental Model

StrongTies treats your professional network as a **graph**:

* **Nodes**: You, companies, roles, hiring managers, connections
* **Edges**: Employment relationships, mutual connections, shared history
* **Edge weights**: Trust, familiarity, proximity, credibility

Networking actions are framed as **message passing**:

| Graph Concept   | Real-World Meaning                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Node embedding  | Your professional profile & reputation   |
| Edge weight     | Strength of a relationship               |
| Message passing | Outreach, conversations, introductions   |
| Gradient update | Adjusting strategy based on feedback     |
| Convergence     | Visibility + trust in the hiring network |

The goal is *not* to “ask for a job.”

The goal is to **maximize the probability that the right people seriously consider you**, mediated by trusted connections.

## What This Repository Contains

This repo provides **guidance and structure**, not a software product.

You’ll find:

* A persistent **context file** (`CONTEXT.md`) for AI chat sessions
* A `/prompts` directory containing **interactive lesson modules**
* Structured guidance on mindset, preparation, outreach, conversations, follow-ups, and referrals
* Example flows and reusable prompt patterns

Everything here is:

* Public
* Open-source
* Tool-agnostic

## How to Use This Guide

StrongTies is designed to be used **interactively**, with an AI chatbot acting as a tutor.

### Quick Start (ChatGPT)

1. Start a new ChatGPT conversation
2. Paste the project context file: `CONTEXT.md`
3. Paste the first lesson module:

   * `prompts/01_orientation_and_intent.md`
4. Say:

> **“Act as the AI tutor described in this file and begin Module 01.”**

The AI will guide you step by step.

When a module ends, paste the next module from `/prompts` and say:

> **“Continue to Module 0X.”**

### Important Notes

* The modules are **intentionally sequenced** — do not skip ahead
* Each module builds on artifacts from previous modules
* The AI tutor is expected to follow each module verbatim

For full details on module sequencing, tutor behavior, and advanced usage (including Custom GPT setup), see **`PROMPTS_README.md`**.

## Guiding Principles

StrongTies is opinionated. It assumes:

* Networking is **not transactional**
* You ask for **advice, not jobs**
* Clarity comes *before* outreach
* Rejection is feedback, not failure
* Long-term relationships beat short-term tactics

If you’re looking for growth hacks or mass-application tricks, this guide is intentionally not that.

---

## Who This Is For

* Job seekers who dislike traditional networking
* Career switchers seeking intentional direction
* Data professionals, engineers, analysts
* Students and early-career professionals
* Anyone who wants a calmer, more principled approach to career growth

You do *not* need to be technical to use this guide.

## Status

This project is under active development.

* Modular prompt packs
* Example end-to-end walkthroughs

Contributions and feedback are welcome.

## License

This guide is intended for **educational and personal use**. Licensing details will be clarified as the project stabilizes.

---

## A Note on Tone

StrongTies is built on respect — for your time, for other people’s time, and for the reality that careers are deeply human systems.

The aim is not to “win” networking.

The aim is to **build real professional ties that compound over time**.
